# ColBERT-PRF ResFiles
This repo contains all the `res files` generated by the ColBERT PRF Ranker and ReRanker models as well as all the baselines reported in our paper "Pseudo-Relevance Feedback for Multiple Representation Dense Retrieval". For each model, as per folder, both TREC 2019 and TREC 2020 res files are included.



## Usage
Results of the ColBERT PRF models as well as the baselines reported in the paper can be reproduced using [PyTerrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier) :
```python
res = pt.io.read_results("/path/to/resfile/BM25.2019.res.gz")
evalMeasuresDict = pt.Utils.evaluate(res,qrels,metrics=["map","recip_rank","recall_1000"])
print(evalMeasuresDict)
```
