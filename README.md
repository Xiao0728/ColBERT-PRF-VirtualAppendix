# ColBERT-PRF Virtual Appendix

This repository is the Virtual Appendix for our ICTIR 2021 paper  "Pseudo-Relevance Feedback for Multiple Representation Dense Retrieval". In particular, the repository contains the results file generated by the ColBERT PRF Ranker and ReRanker models as well as the baselines reported in our paper. For each model, as per folder, both TREC 2019 and TREC 2020 res files are included.

The implementation of ColBERT PRF is available from our [PyTerrier ColBERT plugin](https://github.com/terrierteam/pyterrier_colbert).

## Usage
Results of the ColBERT PRF models as well as the baselines reported in the paper can be reproduced using [PyTerrier](https://github.com/terrier-org/pyterrier):
```python
from pyterrier.measures import *
dataset = pt.get_dataset("trec-deep-learning-passages")
res = pt.io.read_results("/path/to/resfile/BM25.2019.res.gz")
evalMeasuresDict = pt.Utils.evaluate(
  res,
  dataset.get_qrels("test-2019"), 
  metrics=[ AP(rel=2)@1000, nDCG@10, RR(rel=2)@10 ]
)
print(evalMeasuresDict)
```
